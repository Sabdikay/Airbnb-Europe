## 📋 Project Overview

This project analyzes a Airbnb dataset for Europe, originally sourced from Kaggle:
[Airbnb Cleaned Europe Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dipeshkhemani/airbnb-cleaned-europe-dataset/code).

**Key Features:**
- **SQL Analysis:**  
  The `Airbnb.sql` file contains queries and data manipulation routines to analyze various aspects of the dataset.
  
- **Tableau Dashboard:**  
  Explore insights visually with the Tableau dashboard file:
  - **Airbnb Europe.twb** (Tableau Workbook)
  - **Airbnb Dashboard.pdf** (Dashboard Snapshot)

- **Data Files:**  
  The dataset is available in two formats:
  - `Airbnb-Europe-Dataset.csv`
  - `Airbnb-dataset.json`
